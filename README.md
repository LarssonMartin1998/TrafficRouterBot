## Getting started with TrafficRouter
    
This bot should be plug and play for the most part. The only thing you need to do is to create a text-file called "token.txt" under the *.exe-dir\Configs* path, and fill it with your token and get deving.


OBS: Yes I know discord has their own system for commands, I realized that after creating my own, and it works for my needs so I have no plans of changing it for now. It's my first discord BOT ok?
